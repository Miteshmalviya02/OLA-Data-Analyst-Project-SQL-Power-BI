## üîé SQL Analysis

### Queries Implemented:
1. Retrieve all successful bookings  
2. Find the average ride distance for each vehicle type  
3. Get the total number of rides cancelled by customers  
4. List the top 5 customers with the highest number of bookings  
5. Get the number of rides cancelled by drivers (personal & car-related issues)  
6. Find the max and min driver ratings for **Prime Sedan** rides  
7. Retrieve all rides where payment was made via **UPI**  
8. Find the average customer rating per vehicle type  
9. Calculate total booking value of successful rides  
10. List all incomplete rides with their reasons  

‚úÖ All queries were implemented using **SQL Views** for better modularity and reusability.
